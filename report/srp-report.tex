\begin{abstract}
 Saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater aquifers is an ongoing problem that will continue to impact coastal freshwater resources as coastal populations increase.   To effectively model saltwater intrusion, the impacts of  salt content on fluid density must be accounted for to properly model saltwater/freshwater transition zones and sharp interfaces.  We present a model for variable density fluid flow and solute transport where a conforming finite element method discretization with a locally conservative velocity post-processing method is used for the flow model and a variational multi-scale stabilized conforming finite element method is used for transport.   This formulation provides a consistent velocity and performs well even in advection-dominated problems that can occur in saltwater intrusion modeling. The physical model is presented as well as the formulation of the numerical model and solution methods. The model is tested against several 2D and 3D numerical and experimental benchmark problems and the results are presented to verify the code.
